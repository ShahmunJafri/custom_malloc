# custom_malloc
Custom heap allocator created in C--Implemented the free and malloc functions in C. 

This project is a simplified implementation of malloc() and free() in C, designed to simulate memory management through a custom virtual memory allocator. Developed as part of the CSE 29 coursework, it demonstrates core concepts of dynamic memory allocation, block splitting, coalescing, and best-fit strategy.
